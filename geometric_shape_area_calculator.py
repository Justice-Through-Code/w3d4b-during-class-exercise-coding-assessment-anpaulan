    1. First I had to copy the repo from Github
    2. Then clone it to my computer
    3. Because there were no variables for the shapes, I had to enclose them in quotes
    4. Used input function, then assigned variable to new data type
    5. Used type() function to then use conditional to see if variable type was int
    5a. When asking for user input for measurements, had to do this step as well
    6. Rinse and repeat for all shapes
    - I just needed to adjust the formula based on shape
    7. Invalid choice only worked for ints, but not strings, but assignment did not ask for it so I left it
    8. instead of using multiple print statements, I assigned this part to a variable
    9. I ran the unittest, but it failed, so now I am in the process of trying to debug it,
    but all the errors are coming from the test files and not my actual code file
    10. Wish me luck on trying to debug it before I
    10a, Git add (file name) git commmit -m 'My notes', then git push
